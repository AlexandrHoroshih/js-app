# js-app-playground

Goal: build a playground project with React ([Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)) at the frontend and Node.js ([Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/)) at the backend
and then rewrite frontend with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/). 

It means using stuff and writing frontend code as less coupled to React as possible to be able to reuse it later. 

And another goal is just to try to use or implemenent a lot of different stuff on the way and having fun
